Trace and diagonal estimation
=============================

In this example we will explore estimators for the trace and diagonal of a matrix.
:code:`curvlinops` implements different methods, and we will reproduce the results
from their original papers, using toy matrices with a power law spectrum.

#
# Trace estimation
# ----------------
#
# Basics
# ^^^^^^
#
# To get started, let's create a power law matrix and turn it into a linear operator:

Y_mat = create_power_law_matrix()
Y = aslinearoperator(Y_mat)

# %%
#
# For reference, let's compute the exact trace:

exact_trace = trace(Y_mat)
print(f"Exact trace: {exact_trace:.3f}")

# %%
#
# The simplest method for trace estimation is Hutchinson's method.
#
# The idea is to estimate the trace from matrix-vector products with random vectors.
# To obtain better estimates, we can use more queries.
# It is common to repeat this process multiple times to get error estimates.
#
# Let's estimate the trace and see if the estimate is decent:

# matrix-vector queries for one trace estimate
num_matvecs = 5

# Generate estimates, repeat process multiple times so we have error bars.
estimates = [hutchinson_trace(Y, num_matvecs) for _ in range(NUM_REPEATS)]

# Calculate the median and quartiles (error bars) of the estimates
med = median(estimates)
quartile1 = percentile(estimates, 25)
quartile3 = percentile(estimates, 75)

# Print the exact trace and the statistical measures of the estimates
print(f"Exact trace: {exact_trace:.3f}")
print("Estimate:")
print(f"\t- Median: {med:.3f}")
print(f"\t- First quartile (25%): {quartile1:.3f}")
print(f"\t- Third quartile (75%): {quartile3:.3f}")

# Also print whether the true value lies between the quartiles
is_within_quartiles = quartile1 <= exact_trace <= quartile3
print(f"True value within interquartile range? {is_within_quartiles}")
assert is_within_quartiles

# %%
#
# Good! The estimate lies within the error bars.
#
# Comparison
# ^^^^^^^^^^
#
# In the following, we will look at Hutchinson's method and two other algorithms:
# Hutch++ and XTrace. Hutch++ combines vanilla Hutchinson with variance reduction,
# by deterministically computing the trace in a sub-space, and using Hutchinson's
# method in the remaining space. XTrace uses variance reduction from Hutch++,
# and the exchangeability principle (i.e. the estimate is identical when permuting
# the random test vectors). All methods are unbiased, but Hutch++ and XTrace require
# additional memory to store the basis in which the trace is computed exactly.
#
# For matrices whose trace is dominated by a few large eigenvalues, i.e. have fast
# spectral decay, Hutch++ and XTrace can converge faster than vanilla Hutchinson.
# For matrices with slow spectral decay, the benefits of Hutch++ and XTrace become
# less pronounced.
#
# Let's reproduce these results empirically.
#
# We will first consider a power law matrix with high decay rate :math:`c=2.0`:

Y_mat = create_power_law_matrix(c=2.0)

# %%
#
# As before, we will repeat the trace estimation to obtain error bars for each method,
# and investigate how their accuracy evolves as we increase the number of matrix-vector
# products. We use the relative error, which is the absolute value of the difference
# between the estimated and exact trace, divided by the exact trace's absolute value.
#
# Here is a function that computes these relative trace errors for a given matrix:

NUM_MATVECS_HUTCH = unique(linspace(1, 100, 50, dtype=int))
# Hutch++ requires matrix-vector products divisible by 3
NUM_MATVECS_HUTCHPP = unique(NUM_MATVECS_HUTCH + (3 - divmod(NUM_MATVECS_HUTCH, 3)[1]))
# XTrace requires matrix-vector products divisible by 2
