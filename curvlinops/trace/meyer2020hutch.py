class HutchPPTraceEstimator:
    """Class to perform trace estimation with the Huch++ method.

    In contrast to vanilla Hutchinson, Hutch++ has lower variance, but requires more
    memory.

    For details, see

    - Meyer, R. A., Musco, C., Musco, C., & Woodruff, D. P. (2020). Hutch++:
      optimal stochastic trace estimation.

    Example:
        >>> from numpy import trace, mean, round
        >>> from numpy.random import rand, seed
        >>> seed(0) # make deterministic
        >>> A = rand(10, 10)
        >>> tr_A = trace(A) # exact trace as reference
        >>> estimator = HutchPPTraceEstimator(A)
        >>> # one- and multi-sample approximations
        >>> tr_A_low_precision = estimator.sample()
        >>> tr_A_high_precision = mean([estimator.sample() for _ in range(998)])
        >>> # assert abs(tr_A - tr_A_low_precision) > abs(tr_A - tr_A_high_precision)
        >>> round(tr_A, 4), round(tr_A_low_precision, 4), round(tr_A_high_precision, 4)

                Can be at most the linear operator's dimension. By default, its
                size will be 1% of the matrix's dimension, but at most ``10``.

        Note:
            If you are planning to perform a fair (i.e. same computation budget)
            comparison with vanilla Hutchinson, ``basis_dim`` should be ``s / 3``
            where ``s`` is the number of samples used by vanilla Hutchinson. If
            ``s / 3`` requires storing a too large matrix, you can pick
            ``basis_dim = s1`` and draw ``s2`` samples from Hutch++ such that
            ``2 * s1 + s2 = s``.
